                <h2>The History of Verona City</h2>
                <p>Verona City is located in the Veneto Region in Northern Italy. The city lies along the Adige River and has a population of about 260 000 as of 2017. Though we know that the city was founded in the first century BC, the exact details of Verona’s early history continue to be a mystery up till this day. It is said that Verona was a city of the Euganei (a semi-mythical Proto-Italic ethnic group) who had to give up the land to the Cenomani (an ancient tribe of Cisalpine Gauls) – this was estimated to have happened in 550 BC. </p>
                
                <p>Following the conquest of the Valley of the Po, the Veronese territory became Roman at about 300 BC. Verona then became a Roman Colonia (Low-income slum area) in about 89 BC and had officially been classed as a city in 49 BC. The city thrived when the Scaliger family was in rule during the 13th and 14th centuries and as a part of the Republic of Venice from the 15th to the 18th century. Verona has been able to preserve an impressive number of monuments and structures from antiquity, the medieval and Renaissance periods. </p>

                 <p>Piazza delle Erbe (Market's square) is a square in Verona, which was once the town's open outdoor space during the time of the Roman Empire. The square's most ancient monument is the fountain (built in 1368 by Cansignorio della Scala), surmounted by a statue called Madonna Verona, which is however a Roman sculpture dating to 380 AD. The northern side of the square is occupied by the ancient town hall, the Torre Dei Lamberti the Casa dei Giudici ("Judges' Hall") and the frescoed Mazzanti Houses. The western side, the shortest one, features the Baroque Pallazo Maffei decorated by statues of Greek gods.</p>

The tower has 2 bells, the Marangona and the Rengo. The Marangona signals fires, work times, and the hours of the day when it is rung. The Rengo is used to call the population to arms or to invoke the city’s councils. The Torre dei Lamberti is a minute walk away from the Piazza delle Erbe.</p>
