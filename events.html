                 <p>Bacanel del Gnoco, or in english the Verona Carnival, was held on the 16th of February throughout the whole of Verona. There are a lot of theories as to when and why the carnival was started that date all he way back to 1531. In 1900 the carnival was suspended until 1923, and the holiday has been much-loved since. The king of the Festival is Papa Del Gnoco who is portrayed as an old man with a round, red face and a long white beard. He dresses in all brown and pairs the outfit with a red cape and a top with bells. Papa Del Gnoco translates directly into 'Father Dumpling. Traditionally, Papa Del Gnoco is elected by the residents of San Zeno. The King of the festival then grabs his sceptre, which is a giant gnocchi impaled on a golden fork. He then travels on a mule handing out sweets to children and servings of gnocchi with tomato or meat sauce to the adults.'</p>

                 <img src="verona in love.jpg" alt="Love Festival">
                    <p>The Verona in Love festival is held from the 12th of February until the 15th or 16th of February. The Festival is held throughout the entirety of Verona. The streets are usually decorated with large posters, lights are strung up and balloons in the shape of hearts are put up in every space the eye can see. The purpose of the festival is to celebrate love and bring people closer together. Verona is the city that the Shakespearean play Romeo and Juliet was set, and because of this there is a tour specifically for the 'Legend of Romeo and Juliet' in which a guide will accompany guests through the alleyways of the historical centre to discover the secrets of the Shakespearean lovers. The lights and decorations are created specifically to create a warm, romantic and charming atmosphere all the way from Piazza Bra to Juliet's house.</p>
